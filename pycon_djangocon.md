# PyCon: Retrospective
# General
-  Huge
-  Overwhelming
-  My first time in Portland. The city is `#PDXAF`

# Specific
-  Tutorials were great and worth the money. But 4 may have been too many. But I got to meet Harry Percival, who's awesome.
-  I gave up on trying to go to all the talks. Videos were going up REALLY fast!
-  Would definetly PyCon and Portland again

# People I met you may have heard of
-  @nedbat: he remembered me from sprint tutorials AND helped me learn to juggle bowling pins!
-  @hwjp: introduced me to his ORA editor.
-  @heddle317‬: got to thank her for her onboarding videos. She may have thought I was a crazy person. I'd also met a college friend of hers at DjangoCon last year
-  Guido! Got TWO pics w/ him. He looks suspicious of me. :-( But he's super-awesome!
-  Kenneth Reitz: didn't talk to him much, but got a Requests sticker!
-  ‪@BruceEckel‬: yes, THAT Bruce Eckel!
-  @pydanny: I didn't get to talk to his wife, ‪@audreyr‬

# People I met you may NOT have heard of

-  The PyCon 2016 Lightning Talks co-chair (who helped me with ideas)
-  An oceanographer from Brasil who wants to become a dev
-  The DjangoGirlsNYC organizer and a fellow #CodeNewbie
-  Two OTHER #CodeNewbies that I'd talked to on Twitter and on Slack

-  A woman in SF helping kids learn to cook AND code!
-  @glasnt, who works on BeeWare with ‪@freakboy3742‬ 
-  An old man who'd just shoplifted beer and wine from a grocery store. And was BRAGGING about it. He'd also just accepted the stub of a joint from a stranger (NOT part of PyCon. Just outside the OCC #PDXAF)
